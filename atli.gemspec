  ### Yard
  # 
  # I'm not used to dealing with RDoc docstrings, and want to still write doc
  # files in Markdown, but it's been funky to get them to work together...
  # 
  # When things get funky:
  # 
  # 1.  `qb yard/clean`
  # 2.  `bundle exec yard doc`
  # 3.  `locd site restart yard.atli`
  # 
  
  # Doc site generation with `yard`

  # This being installed *seems* to help Yard do the right things with
  # markdown files...

  # These... do not seem to work or help...
